# Drug-Classification-Model
This repository contains a Python implementation of a drug classification model using machine learning techniques. The dataset (drug200.csv) is loaded and preprocessed to train several classification models. The models include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, SVM, and Naive Bayes.

**Features:**

1. Data loading and exploration

2. Preprocessing, including label encoding for categorical variables

3. Train-test split of the dataset

4. Model training using various classifiers

5. Evaluation of model performance with accuracy and additional metrics (precision, recall, F1-score)

6. Prediction for new patients based on the trained models

**Libraries used:**

NumPy,Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn,Scikit-learn

**Models Trained:**

Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors), SVM (Support Vector Machine), Naive Bayes

**Recommendation:**

Decision Tree or Random Forest is recommended for drug classification due to their high accuracy and consistent additional metrics.

Feel free to explore, modify, and contribute to enhance the drug classification model!

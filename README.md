# Drug-Classification-Model
This repository contains a Python implementation of a drug classification model using machine learning techniques. The dataset (drug200.csv) is loaded and preprocessed to train several classification models. The models include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, SVM, and Naive Bayes.

**Features:**

Data loading and exploration

Preprocessing, including label encoding for categorical variables

Train-test split of the dataset

Model training using various classifiers

Evaluation of model performance with accuracy and additional metrics (precision, recall, F1-score)

Prediction for new patients based on the trained models

**Libraries used:**

NumPy,Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn,Scikit-learn

**Models Trained:**

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)

SVM (Support Vector Machine)

Naive Bayes

**Recommendation:**

Decision Tree or Random Forest is recommended for drug classification due to their high accuracy and consistent additional metrics.

Feel free to explore, modify, and contribute to enhance the drug classification model!
